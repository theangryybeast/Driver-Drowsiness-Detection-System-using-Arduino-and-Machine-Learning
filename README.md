# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System

Welcome to the Driver Drowsiness Detection System repository! This project aims to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver's eye movements to detect drowsiness and providing timely alerts to prevent accidents. The system is built using Arduino and Python, leveraging computer vision techniques for real-time monitoring and alerting.

## 📝 Overview

Our system uses advanced computer vision techniques to detect the driver's face and eyes, measuring the Percentage of Eye Closure (PERCLOS) to assess drowsiness. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers an alert, helping to prevent potential accidents.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔍 Real-time face and eye detection**
- **😴 Drowsiness detection using PERCLOS**
- **🔔 Alerts using buzzer and LED**
- **📟 LCD display for status updates**

## 🛠️ Components
